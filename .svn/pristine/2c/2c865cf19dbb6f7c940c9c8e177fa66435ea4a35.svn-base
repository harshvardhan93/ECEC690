Classwork 1: Problem 2
----------------------

 1. Open the file "squares.c". Inside this file,
    you will find that I have already done steps 1--4
    for an algorithm which draws two (possibly overlapping)
    squares (one of #s and one of *s). 

 2. Read the generalized steps that I have written as comments
    in this file.  Note that whenever I indicate a range
    (count from x to y, or between x and y), the range is 
    inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper bound.
    All counting is "count up by one."  Determine if there are
    any parts of these steps that you will want to abstract
    out into a separate function.

 3. Implement this algorithm by translating my steps into code.
    You may abstract any pieces you want out into separate functions.
    If you do so, write these new functions above the "squares" function
    when you finish translating it.

 4. Use the provided Makefile to compile your squares program.
    Test it by comparing its output to the provided squares_ans.txt
    file, which contains the correct output (use redirection and diff).
 
 5. Commit your modified squares.c file into subversion.

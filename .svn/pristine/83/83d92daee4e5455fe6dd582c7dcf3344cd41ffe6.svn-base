Classwork 5: Problem 1
======================

For this problem, you will be black box testing the provided
palindrome program, which I have intentionally placed errors in.
You are only provided with the compiled binary, so your test
case development will truly be black box.

The correct behavior for the palindrome program is as follows:

 - The program takes one command line argument: a file name,
   which it will open, and read each line from the file.

 - For each line in the file, the program will determine if that
   line is a palindrome (the text is the same backwards and forwards).
   If the line is a palindrome, the program will print "Yes".
   If the line is not a palindrome, the program will print "No".

For this assingment, you will come up with two test cases which
break this program.  For each test case, you will write a 
shell script to demonstrate that test case.

The first,
   wrong_output.sh
should run the palindrome program in such a way that it does not
crash, but produces the wrong output.  That is, it either prints
"Yes" for a line which is not a palindrome, or it prints "No" for
a line which is a palindrome.

The second,
   crash.sh
should run the palindrome program in such a way that it crashes
with a segmentation fault.

When you are finished, add and commit both shell scripts, 
as well as any input files that you need to your svn repository.

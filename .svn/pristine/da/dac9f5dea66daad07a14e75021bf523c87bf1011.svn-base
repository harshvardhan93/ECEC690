Classwork 5, Problem 3
======================

For this problem, you will be fixing the provided code in sort.c,
which is supposed to sort its command line arguments (which should all
be ints).  Use gdb to fix this program so that it correctly sorts
the array (places the elements in ascending order).  The main
function prints the sorted array, one element per line.

Note that this program does not check that its arguments are actually
ints.  For this program, we will consider the behavior of atoi to be
correct with no error checking.

Note: if you need to stop a program in an infinite loop while you are
running it in the terminal, press Ctrl-C.  If you need to stop it 
while you are running it in emacs, you will need to press Ctrl-C twice.

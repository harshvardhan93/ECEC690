Classwork 1: Problem 1
----------------------

 1. Create a file "answer.txt".
 2. Execute the following code by hand 
   (as we do in the lecture videos), and write
   the output in your "answer.txt" file

//start of code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int anotherFunction(int a, int b) {
  int answer = 42;
  int x = 0;
  printf("In anotherFunction(%d,%d)\n",a,b);
  while (b > a) {
    printf("a is %d, b is %d\n", a, b);
    answer = answer + (b - a);
    b -= x;
    a += x / 2;
    x++;
  }
  return answer;
}


int someFunction(int x, int y) {
  int a = x + y;
  if (x < y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
      printf("In the loop with i = %d, a = %d\n", i, a);
      a = a + x;
    }
  }
  else {
    y = anotherFunction(y,a+4);
  }
  return a * y;
}

int main(void) {
  int x = 2;
  int a = someFunction(x,3);
  printf("a = %d\n", a);
  printf("x = %d\n", x);
  int b = someFunction(3,x);
  printf("b = %d\n", b);
  printf("x = %d\n", x);
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


//end of code

 3. Check your work in part 2 by
    (a) creating a file "test.c"
    (b) copying and pasting the code from above into the "test.c" file
        [remember: ctrl-space sets the mark, esc-w copies, and ctrl-y pastes]
    (c) Compile your test.c program using the provided Makefile
        [remember you can hit ctrl-c ctrl-v to compile]
    (d) Run the newly created program (test) and redirect the output to 
        the file  test.out:
            ./test > test.out
    (e) Use the diff command to compare the contents of test.out with
        the contents of your answer.txt file
           diff test.out answer.txt
        Note that if diff prints nothing, the files are the same.
        If there are differences, it will print them out with 
        < and > signs to indicate which file the differing lines are from
    (f) If your answer.txt file is no correct, retry the problem 
        and/or ask for help.  Repeat 2 and 3 until it is correct.

 4. Use svn add and svn commit to check your answer.txt and 
    test.c file into subversion

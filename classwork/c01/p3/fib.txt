Step 1: Find the Fibonacci series 5th term.
 Here N=5
 0th term = 0
 1st term = 1
 2nd term = 1 (0+1)
 3rd term = 2 (1+1)
 4th term = 3 (1+2)
 5th term = 5 (2+3)

Step 2:
Consider the first and second terms to be 0 & 1
Now,
3rd term = sum of terms one and two
4th term = sum of terms two and three
5th term = sum of terms three and four

Step 3:
Let the first term be p (previous) and the second term to be n(new).
Let p be 0 and n be 1.
Run a loop from 0 to (N-1).
    Compute the sum of p and n and assign the sum to n
    Now subtract p from the new n and assign it to p.
Return the value of p

In the cases involving 0 and lesser values, the answer returned is always 0 since we never enter the loop and always return the initial assinged value of p which is 0.
 
Step 4:
Let us compute the 6th term of the Fibonacci series using the above algorithm.
Let us take p=0 and n=1
Now we run a loop from 0 to 5
    
for i=0
    n=1, p=1
for i=1
    n=2, p=1
for i=2
    n=3, p=2
for i=3
    n=5, p=3
for i=4
    n=8, p=5
for i=5
    n=13,p=8

return p

The returned value is 8 which is correct.
